\subsubsection[title={FREELANCE DEVELOPER: Jan 2020 -
Present},reference={freelance-developer-jan-2020---present}]

Delivering tools such as static websites for local business, Django
platforms with SQL databases, web scrapers, Python automation tools and
basic data engineering using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.

Delivered an internet monitor thingy

I am a maintainer of the open source Dracula organisation, developing
dark themes for software developers. I have deployed a personal
knowledge management website (notes.ajb.app). Overcoming the challenge
of how to link connected notes, organise information associatively and
weed out segmentation. (The site works on top of a local folder of plain
text Markdown files). I try to have a product mindset in everything I
design and understand creating value, not features.

Stuff about getting clients and stuff

Using python and Pandas to process restaurant timesheets.

In addition I have built a number of web components to test my skills
such as a blogging platform built in Django and a JavaScript bug tracker
to demonstrate CRUD application in the browser. An HTML sign-up form to
demonstrate client-side form validation. Linux basic sysadmin tasks. I
have not been married to one technology and choose the right tool for
the job. Along the way I have used tools and techniques such as: Object
Oriented Programming. Pyenv and PIP to manage virtual environments and
dependencies. Test Driven Development. CSS and Bootstrap. Jekyll to
manage static web hosting. Linux and MacOS operating systems. Git and
GitHub for version control. Project Management skills to manage
workflows and time management. I am currently working towards delivering
a project in C/C++ to further my understanding on the language and
system operations.

\startdescription{My Cool Side Project}
  For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition list
  can be used to have named items.

  \startitemize[packed]

    These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
    indentation levels in the markdown source.

\startdescription{Open Source}
  List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on the
  project names, for example the {\bf Linux Kernel}, where you
  implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or {\bf node.js} (with
  \useURL[url5][http://nodejs.org][][link]\from[url5]) which was
  actually totally your idea\ldots{}

\startdescription{Programming Languages}
  {\bf first-lang:} Here, we have an itemization, where we only want to
  add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to mention
  some others together at the end. A format that works well here is a
  description list where the first few items have their first word
  emphasized, and the last item contains the final few emphasized terms.
  Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf version, which
  wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

  {\bf second-lang:} Description of your experience with second-lang,
  perhaps again including a {[}link{]}
  \useURL[url6][https://github.com/githubuser/superlongprojectname][][ref]\from[url6],
  this time placing the url reference elsewhere in the document to
  reduce clutter (see source file).

  {\bf obscure-but-impressive-lang:} We both know this one's pushing it.

  Basic knowledge of {\bf C}, {\bf x86 assembly}, {\bf forth},
  {\bf Common Lisp}
