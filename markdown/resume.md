## Technical Experience

- Item with [link](http://www.example.com). Links will work both in
  the html and pdf versions.

### FREELANCE DEVELOPER: Jan 2020 - Present

Delivering tools such as static websites for local business, Django platforms with SQL databases, web scrapers, Python automation tools and basic data engineering using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.

Delivered an internet monitor thingy

I am a maintainer of the open source Dracula organisation, developing dark themes for software developers. I have deployed a personal knowledge management website (notes.ajb.app). Overcoming the challenge of how to link connected notes, organise information associatively and weed out segmentation. (The site works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files). I try to have a product mindset in everything I design and understand creating value, not features.

Stuff about getting clients and stuff

Using python and Pandas to process restaurant timesheets.

In addition I have built a number of web components to test my skills such as a blogging platform built in Django and a JavaScript bug tracker to demonstrate CRUD application in the browser. An HTML sign-up form to demonstrate client-side form validation. Linux basic sysadmin tasks. I have not been married to one technology and choose the right tool for the job. Along the way I have used tools and techniques such as: Object Oriented Programming. Pyenv and PIP to manage virtual environments and dependencies. Test Driven Development. CSS and Bootstrap. Jekyll to manage static web hosting. Linux and MacOS operating systems. Git and GitHub for version control. Project Management skills to manage workflows and time management. I am currently working towards delivering a project in C/C++ to further my understanding on the language and system operations.

My Cool Side Project
: For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source

: List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
(with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
your idea...

Programming Languages

: **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
here is a description list where the first few items have their
first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

: **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
file).

: **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
it.

: Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**
