## Technical Experience

### FREELANCE DEVELOPER: Jan 2020 - Present

Delivering tools such as static websites for local business, Django platforms with SQL databases, web scrapers, Python automation tools and basic data engineering using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.

Delivered an internet monitor thingy

Stuff about getting clients and stuff

Using python and Pandas to process restaurant timesheets.

In addition I have built a number of web components to test my skills such as a blogging platform built in Django and a JavaScript bug tracker to demonstrate CRUD application in the browser. An HTML sign-up form to demonstrate client-side form validation. Linux basic sysadmin tasks. I have not been married to one technology and choose the right tool for the job. Along the way I have used tools and techniques such as: Object Oriented Programming. Pyenv and PIP to manage virtual environments and dependencies. Test Driven Development. CSS and Bootstrap. Jekyll to manage static web hosting. Linux and MacOS operating systems. Git and GitHub for version control. Project Management skills to manage workflows and time management. I am currently working towards delivering a project in C/C++ to further my understanding on the language and system operations.

### Open Source Projects

I am a maintainer of the open source Dracula organisation, developing dark themes for software developers.

I have deployed a personal knowledge management website (notes.ajb.app). Overcoming the challenge of how to link connected notes, organise information associatively and weed out segmentation. (The site works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files). I try to have a product mindset in everything I design and understand creating value, not features.

Something about note platforms here. (digital gardners)

List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js** (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally your idea...
